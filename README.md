This project is a basic random password generator that will take a set of conditions set by the user to create a unique password to be copied from the page once the user completes prompts asking for their requirements.

The user will only be able to access the prompts once the user clicks generate password, the user will then navigate through the options available to suit their needs.

The options available to the user are the following:
- If the user would like to set a length for their password 
  -If the user chooses yes, they will be able to choose from a min char limit of 8 and a max of 128
  -If the user chooses no, the password will default to a length of 8 char

- If the user would like to use any lowercase letters
- If the user would like to use any uppercase letters
- If the user would like to use any numbers
- If the user would like to use any special char
